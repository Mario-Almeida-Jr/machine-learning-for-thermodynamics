# machine-learning-for-thermodynamics

Using a simple machine learning model to predict the thermodynamical activity coefficient of 2,2-Dimethylbutane in a binary mixture with chloroform
The implementation was based on five experimental data simulated from unifac thermo.py and the machine model was trained for 1000 times
The mean recovery achieved was 95% for one unit and number of training of 1000 times
