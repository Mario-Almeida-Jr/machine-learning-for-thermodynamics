# machine-learning-for-thermodynamics

Using a simple machine learning model to predict the thermodynamical activity coefficient of 2,2-Dimethylbutane in a binary mixture with chloroform
The implementation was based on five experimental data simulated from unifac thermo.py and the machine model was trained for 1000 times
The recovery achieved was 100.5%
